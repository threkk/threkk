Most of the articles I write are about things that I am interested, or I have been working with recently.
This is usually about *nix, git, JavaScript, and Go, although  it could be almost anything, and might change in the future.
The periodicity of the publications is based on a combination of inspiration and how long it takes the article to be ready.
My current objective is to write one article per season of the year.
Currently, the articles are hosted on Medium. 
The main reason so far is that it is the easiest way for me to reach more readers.
I am planning to add a mirror in this page, but there is no estimated time for that.

If you have any feedback about the articles, or a suggestion for a new one, don't hesitate to reach me!
It makes me happy when I know someone has read any of them.
