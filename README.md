# Hi, my name is Alberto de Murga

> also known as threkk

I am a ~~Internet Plumber~~ <span class='p-role'>Software Engineer</span>
based in <span class='p-locality'>Amsterdam</span>, <span class='p-country-name'>
The Netherlands</span>. Currently, I am working at [<span class='p-org has-text-primary'>
Booking.com</span>](https://booking.com) as <span class='p-job-title'>
full stack developer</span> on experimentation quality.

I [write](https://threkk.medium.com) about \*nix, JavaScript and Go among others.
I also collaborate in open source projects like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com).
In the past, I spent long time researching about static analysis in Javascript,
focusing on detecting dead code.

In my free time, I am an avid reader, games and e-sports aficionado and ok painter.
From time to time I also build [things](https://github.com/threkk).
