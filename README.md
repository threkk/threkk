# Hi, my name is Alberto de Murga

> also known as threkk

I am a ~~Internet Plumber~~ <span class='p-role'>Software Engineer</span>
based in <span class='p-locality'>Amsterdam</span>, <span class='p-country-name'>
The Netherlands</span>, where I work at [<span class='p-org'>
Booking.com</span>](https://booking.com) as <span class='p-job-title'>
full stack Software Engineer</span> on improving experimentation quality.

I [have a blog](https://threkk.medium.com) where I write about \*nix, git, JavaScript and Go among others.
In the past, I researched about [static analysis](https://github.com/threkk/prune.js) in JavaScript focusing on detecting dead code.

In my free time, I study Korean (<span lang='ko'>저는 초보자예요</span>), play more videogames that I should,
start more books than I finish, and paint less than I believe. From time to time I also
[build things](https://github.com/threkk).
