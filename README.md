# Hi, my name is Alberto de Murga

> also known as threkk

I am a ~~Internet Plumber~~ <span class='p-role'>Software Engineer</span> based in <span class='p-locality'>Amsterdam</span>, <span class='p-country-name'>The Netherlands</span>, where I work at [<span class='p-org'>
Booking.com</span>](https://booking.com 'https://booking.com') as <span class='p-job-title'>
full stack Software Engineer</span> making experimentation and A/B testing better.

I like to [make things](https://github.com/threkk), and sometimes I [write about it](https://threkk.medium.com). In the past, I researched about [static analysis](https://github.com/threkk/prune.js 'https://github.com/threkk/prune.js') in JavaScript focusing on detecting dead code.

I am also insterested in learning languages (currently Korean), video games (RPG, roguelites), miniature painting (Games Workshop, Para Bellum), TTRPG, and a fantasy fiction books.
