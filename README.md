# Hi, my name is Alberto
> also known as threkk
I am a Software Engineer from Spain based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
Currently, I am working at Booking.com as full stack developer on experimentation
quality.

My main expertise is in JavaScript, both frontend and backend, which I have been
using since I was 12 years old and I am researching about it as part of my
MSc. Software Engineering at the University of Amsterdam. I have also experience
with Python, Perl and Go.
